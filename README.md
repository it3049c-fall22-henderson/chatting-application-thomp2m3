## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
I struggled a bit with last week's project, but feel I did much better this week.  I use API end points at work on a daily basis, so it was very cool to see some of the behind the scenes functionality.  Learning more about CSS via bootstrap is really intriguing as well.

### How long it took me to finish this?
~4 hours

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?

The display property in bootstrap emphasizes the header based the numerical value you assign to the property.  1 is the largest, so in our instance display-4 would create a larger header for us and something for the end user to see easily.
